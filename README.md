Perl scripts for bioinformatics

It's been over 15 years since I started bioinformatics with Perl. By looking back into my scripts, they honestly recorded my working history. I hope that sharing my scripts will benefit those NEWBIEs who begin to learn bioinformatics.

More information about this repo will be updated from time to time... No guarantee, but will do my BEST.

Drop me a message if you have any questions.
